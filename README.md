# LAX Passenger Traffic Analysis

This project analyzes passenger flow and trends at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) from 2018 to 2023. Using Matplotlib visualizations, probability/statistics, and seasonal pattern analysis, it aims to uncover insights for terminal optimization.

## Key Components
Data Source: LAX Passenger Traffic Dataset (2018â€“2023)
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
Methods: Static Visualization, Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Seasonal Trend Analysis

## Visualizations
- Terminal-wise passenger trends
- Hourly activity patterns
- Domestic vs. International breakdown
- Monthly/seasonal flow analysis

## Statistical Analysis
- Chi-Square Test for Terminal vs. Arrival/Departure association
